## Philosophy

Many engineers find it painful to work out how their products are being used. This makes design decisions tough. PostHog solves that.

In our view, third-party analytics does not work anymore in a world of cookie laws, GDPR, CCPA, and many other four-letter acronyms. There should be an alternative to sending all of your customers' personal information and usage data to third-parties like Google.

PostHog gives you full control over all the data from your users, while allowing anyone to do powerful analytics.

This means you can know who is using your app, how they're using it, and where you lose users, among [many other things](https://posthog.com/product-features).

## What's Cool About This?

PostHog is the only **product-focused** open-source analytics library, with an event and user-driven architecture. That means tracking identifiable (where applicable) user behavior, and creating user profiles. We are an open-source alternative to products such as Mixpanel, Amplitude, or Heap, that's designed to be more developer-friendly than them, with a broader range of features like session recording, heatmaps, feature flags and plugins.

There are a few session-based open-source libraries that are nice alternatives to Google Analytics. That's not what we are focused on.
